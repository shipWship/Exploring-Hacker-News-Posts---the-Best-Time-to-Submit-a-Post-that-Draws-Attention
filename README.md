# Exploring-Hacker-News-Posts---the-Best-Time-to-Submit-a-Post-that-Draws-Attention

## Goal of the Project

Our project interested in analysing the posts with titles starting with:

- `Ask HN`: The posts for **asking** Hacker News community **a specific question**.
- `Show HN`: The posts for **sharing** with the community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.

The goal of our project is to compare these two types of posts to **study whether the number of comments and points (total number of upvotes) is influenced by**:

- **The type of posts** — either `Ask HN` or `Show HN`?
- **The submission time of the posts** — what time?

## Summary of Results

Based on our data analysis, we concluded that **`Ask HN` has a slightly higher number of comments** and the best time to get high attention is submitting a post is at **22:00 Eastern European Time (EET) our time (or 15:00 Eastern Time, EST)**. On the other hand, **`Share HN` has a higher average points, and its top hour is at 06:00 EET or 23:00 EST**.
